Sample (placeholder) automations demonstrating:
- **Order-to-Delivery** e-commerce flow using Stripe webhooks
- **Ticket-Triage** flow that tags GameStop incidents and notifies teams

Each sub-folder contains:
1. `workflow.json` – exported from n8n
2. `README.md` – purpose, node map, performance notes
3. `customNode.js` – only if the workflow extends n8n

> Real JSON exports will be pushed as soon as NDA clearance is complete.
